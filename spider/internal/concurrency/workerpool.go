// WorkerPool is an implementation of a start/stoppable worker pool.
//
// In this implementation, jobs are essentially tokens to perform some work. Jobs are not delivered
// to the pool, but instead 'claimed' by a worker, and 'returned' when finished (technically, a new job
// is posted to the queue). In this case, the worker itself is the one which determines the work it should do.
// This gives a lot of flexibility when combined with implementations of Worker.
//
// It uses a number of channels to control the concurrency:
// - jobs is a buffered channel that signals that a worker should process a job
// - results signals that a result was computed by work()
// - errors collects any errors from work(). An error on the channel will stop the ingester
// - done is used to signal when the ingester has totally stopped (i.e. all workers drained)
